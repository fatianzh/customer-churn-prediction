# customer-churn-prediction

The rapid development of the technology industry has resulted in many telecommunication companies and internet service providers which can lead to competition. This can also make customers change providers so that it is interpreted as customer churn. Detecting customer churn from the beginning can make a company maintain its market.

In this project, we create a machine learning model to predict the customer churn. So, the model can help telecommunication companies and internet service providers to detect early signs of potential churn so that they can reduce customer losses and implement effective retention strategies.
